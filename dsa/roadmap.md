## DSA Roadmap

Taken from [twiiter](https://twitter.com/ainasanghi/status/1702272855801741606)

Step by Step guide DSA in 100 days with resources :

Day ♾ to 0:

- Stick  to a programming language like C/C++ or Java. 
- Make sure you're comfortable with pointers/objects.

Day 1:

- Understanding the concept of algorithmic complexity . 
- Skip the theory for now, but for every piece of code you write, you should be able to derive both time and space complexity.

Day 2-10 :

Start with some simple data structures,
- Arrays
- Linked List
- Strings 
- Stacks 
- Queues

Understand their basic operations ( insert, delete, search, traversal) and their complexity - Big O Algorithm Complexity Cheat sheet, and code them all.

Day 11-25 :

Now learn some simple algorithms :
- Sorting 
- Search
- Prime Numbers
- Strings
- Miscellaneous

Resources:
For this you look to Abdul Bari's youtube channel. He is simply brilliant at explaining algorithms. Watch his algorithm playlist in order

Day 26-50 :

Once you are comfortable with everything above, start doing problems from
- Leetcode
- GeeksforGeeks
- HackerRank
- Codeforces
- InterviewBit
- Cracking the coding interview
- Elements of programming Interviews

Stick to chapters of arrays, linked list, strings, stacks, queues, and complexity.

Day 51-60 :

Learn some non-linear data structures now

- Tree
      ~ Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree
      ~ Heaps
- Hash Table
- Graph

Day 61-90 :

Refer to the previous resources and start doing problems from trees, hash tables, heaps and graphs.

Day 91-100:

Understand:
- Computational complexity theory
- and NP- completeness
- Knapsack problem
- Travelling Salesman problem
- SAT problem

Day 101-♾:

You are now better than most of the CS undergrads.

Keep revising the previous topics and start competitive programming! Good luck!
